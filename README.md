A simple Sudoku solver implemented in C# using a backtracking algorithm, also known as a depth-first search approach.
The project demonstrates how a brute-force search can efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles by systematically exploring all possible combinations until a valid solution is found.


Unit Tests:

The project includes xUnit tests that ensures that the solver correctly identifies valid and invalid Sudoku puzzles and returns the correct solution.
